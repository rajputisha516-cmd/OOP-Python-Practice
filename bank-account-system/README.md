# Problem 1: Bank Account System (OOP Practice – Python)

## 📌 Objective
This project is created to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python by designing a real-world **Bank Account System**.

The focus is on applying **encapsulation, validation logic, and clean class design** rather than building a full application.

---

## 🏦 System Overview
The system models a bank account with real-world rules such as:
- Different account types (Savings & Current)
- Minimum balance enforcement
- Secure balance handling
- Transaction history tracking

Each account object manages its own data and behavior.

---

## ✨ Features Implemented
- Account holder details and account number
- Account types:
  - Savings account (minimum balance required)
  - Current account (no minimum balance)
- Deposit and withdrawal with validation
- Encapsulated balance attribute
- Transaction history maintained inside the class
- Separate logic and execution files

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used
- Classes and Objects  
- Encapsulation (private balance attribute)  
- Validation logic  
- Real-world system modeling  
- Separation of concerns
